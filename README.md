# Vue-Ts-Templater

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/vue-ts-templater)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-ts-templater)


A light weight nodej script which builds a vue-ts component for you.

**Problem**, at my intern we basically deal with building Vue + TS application and writing that boilerplate component file is irritating, so I wrote a very basic nodejs script, which takes argument '--name' or 'name' and serves Vue + TS Component file.

### Installation

`npm i -g vue-ts-templater`

### Getting started
- Go to the directory where you want to add vue ts component.
- Run `vue-ts-templater --name=template_name`
